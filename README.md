# What is this project?
This is a simple program that helps you organize files by their extension and creation time. It work by running the program and dropping files into "folder_to_track" and then sorting and moving the items to "folder_destination". These two parameters are set in the bottom of the main python script. The program was written with Windows in mind but could likely easily be ported to UNIX systems with some smaller tweaks to the directory names.

# Beware
This project is not maintained and I make no guarantees that the dependencies are still working.
